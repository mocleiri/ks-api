/**
 * Kuali customized Torque's database.dtd by adding sequence and view. Thus we need to use our
 * custom dtd instead of the latest one from Torque. At the moment the Kuali database.dtd is stored
 * in many different spots inside Subversion. This is because the impex was not set up with XML
 * parsing/generation so as to be able to read Kuali's customized database.dtd off of the
 * classpath. Thus database.dtd has to be present on the file system in the same directory as any
 * schema.xml files that are being parsed.
 * 
 * This class allows a single copy of database.dtd to be bundled into a .jar and shared by everyone
 * at Kuali.
