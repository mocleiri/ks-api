== 0.7.8 (2010-05-09)
  * Fixed gemspec to include missing files (*.yml, *.gz, .autotest and spec/spec.opts) in the gem.

== 0.7.7 (2010-05-09)
  * SOAP requests now start with a proper XML declaration.
  * Added support for gzipped requests and responses (http://github.com/lucascs). While gzipped SOAP
    responses are decoded automatically, you have to manually instruct Savon to gzip SOAP requests:

      client = Savon::Client.new "http://example.com/UserService?wsdl", :gzip => true

  * Fix for issue #51. Added the :soap_endpoint option to Savon::Client.new which let's you specify a SOAP
    endpoint per client instance:

    client = Savon::Client.new "http://example.com/UserService?wsdl",
      :soap_endpoint => "http://localhost/UserService"

  * Fix for issue #50. Savon still escapes special characters in SOAP request Hash values, but you can now
    append an exclamation mark to Hash keys specifying that it's value should not be escaped.

== 0.7.6 (2010-03-21)
  * Moved documentation from the Github Wiki to the actual class files and established a much nicer
    documentation combining examples and implementation (using Hanna) at: http://savon.rubiii.com
  * Added Savon::Client#call as a workaround for dispatching calls to SOAP actions  named after
	  existing methods. Fix for issue #48.
  * Add support for specifying attributes for duplicate tags (via Hash values as Arrays). Fix for issue #45.
  * Fix for issue #41 (Escape special characters (e.g. &) for XML requests).
  * Fix for issue #39 and #49. Added Savon::SOAP#xml which let's you specify completely custom SOAP request XML.

== 0.7.5 (2010-02-19)
  * Fix for issue #34 (soap_actions returns empty for wsdl12).
  * Fix for issue #36 (Custom WSDL actions broken).
  * Added feature requested in issue #35 (Setting an attribute on an element?).
  * Changed the key for specifying the order of tags from :@inorder to :order!

== 0.7.4 (2010-02-02)
  * Fix for issue #33 (undefined method 'start_with?').

== 0.7.3 (2010-01-31)
  * Added support for Geotrust-style WSDL documents (Julian Kornberger <github.corny@digineo.de>).
  * Make HTTP requests include path and query only. This was breaking requests via proxy as scheme and host
    were repeated (Adrian Mugnolo <adrian@mugnolo.com>)
  * Avoid warning on 1.8.7 and 1.9.1 (Adrian Mugnolo <adrian@mugnolo.com>).
  * Fix for issue #29 (WSSE Created Bug?). Default to UTC to xs:dateTime value for WSSE authentication.
  * Fix for issue #28 (Undefined Method ssl? on URI::Generic).
  * Fix for issue #27 (http content-type defaults to utf-8). The Content-Type now defaults to UTF-8.
  * Modification to allow assignment of an Array with an input name and an optional Hash of values to soap.input.
    Patches issue #30 (stanleydrew <andrewmbenton@gmail.com>).
  * Fix for issue #25 (header-tag should not be sent if not set).

== 0.7.2 (2010-01-17)
  * Exposed the Net::HTTP response (added by Kevin Ingolfsland). Use the "http" accessor (response.http) on your
    Savon::Response to access the Net::HTTP response object.
  * Fix for issue #21 (savon is stripping ?SOAP off the end of WSDL locations).
  * Fix for issue #22 (REXML::ParseException parsing 401 Unauthorized response body).
  * Fix for issue #19 (Unable to set attribute in name-spaced WSSE password element).
  * Added support for global header and namespaces. See issue #9 (Setting headers and namespaces).

== 0.7.1 (2010-01-10)
  * The Hash of HTTP headers for SOAP calls is now public via Savon::Request#headers.
    Patch for: http://github.com/rubiii/savon/issues/#issue/8

== 0.7.0 (2010-01-09)
  This version comes with several changes to the public API!
  Pay attention to the following list and read the updated Wiki: http://wiki.github.com/rubiii/savon

  * Changed how Savon::WSDL can be disabled. Instead of disabling the WSDL globally/per request via two
    different methods, you now simply append an exclamation mark (!) to your SOAP call: client.get_all_users!
    Make sure you know what you're doing because when the WSDL is disabled, Savon does not know about which
    SOAP actions are valid and just dispatches everything.
  * The Net::HTTP object used by Savon::Request to retrieve WSDL documents and execute SOAP calls is now public.
    While this makes the library even more flexible, it also comes with two major changes:
    * SSL client authentication needs to be defined directly on the Net::HTTP object:
      client.request.http.client_cert = ...
      I added a shortcut method for setting all options through a Hash similar to the previous implementation:
      client.request.http.ssl_client_auth :client_cert => ...
    * Open and read timeouts also need to be set on the Net::HTTP object:
      client.request.http.open_timeout = 30
      client.request.http.read_timeout = 30
    * Please refer to the Net::HTTP documentation for more details:
      http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib/libdoc/net/http/rdoc/index.html
  * Thanks to JulianMorrison, Savon now supports HTTP basic authentication:
    client.request.http.basic_auth "username", "password"
  * Julian also added a way to explicitly specify the order of Hash keys and values, so you should now be able
    to work with services requiring a specific order of input parameters while still using Hash input.
    For example: client.find_user { |soap| soap.body = { :name => "Lucy", :id => 666, :@inorder => [:id, :name] } }
  * Savon::Response#to_hash now returns the content inside of "soap:Body" instead of trying to go one level
    deeper and return it's content. The previous implementation only worked when the "soap:Body" element
    contained a single child. See: http://github.com/rubiii/savon/issues#issue/17
  * Added Savon::SOAP#namespace as a shortcut for setting the "xmlns:wsdl" namespace.
    Usage example: soap.namespace = "http://example.com"

== 0.6.8 (2010-01-01)
  * Improved specifications for various kinds of WSDL documents.
  * Added support for SOAP endpoints which are different than the WSDL endpoint of a service.
  * Changed how SOAP actions and inputs are retrieved from the WSDL documents. This might break a few existing
    implementations, but makes Savon work well with even more services. If this change breaks your implementation,
    please take a look at the +action+ and +input+ methods of the Savon::SOAP object.
    One specific problem I know of is working with the createsend WSDL and its namespaced actions.
    To make it work, call the SOAP action without namespace and specify the input manually:
    client.get_api_key { |soap| soap.input = "User.GetApiKey" }

== 0.6.7 (2009-12-18)
  * Implemented support for a proxy server. The proxy URI can be set through an optional Hash of options passed
    to instantiating Savon::Client (Dave Woodward <dave@futuremint.com>)
  * Implemented support for SSL client authentication. Settings can be set through an optional Hash of arguments
    passed to instantiating Savon::Client (colonhyphenp)
  * Patch for issue #10 (Problem with operation tags without a namespace).

== 0.6.6 (2009-12-14)
  * Default to use the name of the SOAP action (the method called in a client) in lowerCamelCase for SOAP action
    and input when Savon::WSDL is disabled. You still need to specify soap.action and maybe soap.input in case
    your SOAP actions are named any different.

== 0.6.5 (2009-12-13)
  * Added an open_timeout method to Savon::Request.

== 0.6.4 (2009-12-13)
  * Refactored specs to be less unit-like.
  * Added a getter for the Savon::Request to Savon::Client and a read_timeout setter for HTTP requests.
  * wsdl.soap_actions now returns an Array of SOAP actions. For the previous "mapping" please use wsdl.operations.
  * Replaced WSDL document with stream parsing.
