== Welcome to ks-cuke-testing

Cucumber is a testing framework that enables testing of web applications with simple
syntax but powerful engine based on Ruby scripting. 
It does not require directly Rails support but some gems may use Rails web libraries, 
e.g. Culerity. 

For more information about how to install and use the framework please see doc/README_FOR_APP
