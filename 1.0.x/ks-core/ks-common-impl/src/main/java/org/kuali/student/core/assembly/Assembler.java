/*
 *	ASSEMBLERREVIEW
 *  1) The combination of persistence and translation methods (assemble/disassemble vs get/save):
 *  	- has confused some developers
 *  	- after working through some of it, it looks like most assemblers would do one or other other
 *  	- TargetType vs SourceType is odd looking for persistence only assembers, ends up being Assembler<Whatever, Void>
 *  
 *  2) Needs search/lookup operations based on LookupMetadata
 *  
 *  3) Need to come up with a clean way of copying properties that are passthrough without a lot of boilerplate code, but...
 *  	- many "passthrough" properties will still have a rename along the way, and possibly a transformation of their position within the graph, e.g.
 *  		cluInfo/officialIdentifier/shortName -> proposal/transcriptTitle
