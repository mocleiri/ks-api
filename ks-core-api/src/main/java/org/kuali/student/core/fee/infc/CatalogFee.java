/**
 * The CatalogFee is a list of "canonical" fees in a "catalog" that
 * can be used in establishing an actual Fee.
 *
 * The Catalog Fee has one of three flavors indicated by its Type:
 *
 *    1. Flat - A fee that doesn't vary. The Catalog Fee specifies
 *              a minimum and maxmimum amount to constrain the Fee.
 *  
 *    2. Fixed Credit - A fee per credit where the total amount is
 *                      the fee multiplied by the credits (or units) 
 *                      determined by what the fee applies to. The 
 *                      Catalog Fee specifies a minimum and maxmimum
 *                      amount for the fee per credit.
 * 
 *    3. Flexible Credit - A specific fee for each credit value. The
 *                         Catalog Fee specifies the list of
 *                         acceptable values (amount and number of
 *                         credits) allowed in a Fee.
