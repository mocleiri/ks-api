/**
 * The Catalog Fee is a list of "canonical" fees in a "catalog" that
 * can be used in establishing an actual Fee.
 *
 * The Catalog Fee has one of three flavors indicated by its Type:
 *
 * <dl>

 *    <dt>Flat</dt> <dd>A fee that doesn't vary. The Catalog Fee
 *                  specifies a minimum and maxmimum amount to
 *                  constrain the Fee.</dd>
 *  
 *    <dt>Fixed Credit</dt> <dd>A fee per credit where the total
 *                          amount is the fee multiplied by the
 *                          credits (or units) determined by what this
 *                          Fee applies to. The Catalog Fee specifies
 *                          a minimum and axmimum amount for the fee
 *                          per credit hour.</dd>
 * 
 *    <dt>Flexible Credit</dt> <dd>A specific fee for each credit
 *                             value. The Catalog Fee specifies the
 *                             list of acceptable valued (amount and
 *                             number of credits allowed in a
 *                             Fee.</dd> </dl> 1. Flat - A fee that
 *                             doesn't vary. The Catalog Fee specifies
 *                             a minimum and maxmimum amount to
 *                             constrain the Fee.</dd>
 * </dl>
 *
 * The Fee Catalog is effective during its applicable ATPs.
